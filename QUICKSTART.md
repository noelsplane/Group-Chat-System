# Quick Start Guide
## Operating Systems Final Project - C++ Group Chat System

## What Has Been Created

Your complete Operating Systems final project has been set up with:

### ✅ Project Structure
```
GroupChat/
├── client/          - Chat client with CLI interface
├── server/          - Multi-threaded chat server
├── shared/          - Protocol definitions, cache, utilities
├── logs/            - Log file directory
├── diagrams/        - For architecture diagrams
├── tests/           - Test files
├── CMakeLists.txt   - Build configuration
└── README.md        - Full documentation
```

### ✅ Core Components Implemented

1. **Binary Protocol** (`shared/protocol.h`)
   - ChatPacket structure with 10 message types
   - Network byte order conversion

2. **LRU Cache** (`shared/cache.h`)
   - Least Recently Used eviction policy
   - TTL (time-to-live) support
   - Thread-safe with statistics tracking

3. **Thread Pool** (`server/thread_pool.cpp`)
   - Round Robin scheduling
   - Shortest Job First scheduling
   - Worker thread management

4. **Group Manager** (`server/group_manager.cpp`)
   - Multi-group support
   - Client membership tracking
   - Thread-safe group operations

5. **Server** (`server/main.cpp`)
   - TCP socket server
   - Signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
   - Client connection management
   - Message broadcasting

6. **Client** (`client/main.cpp`)
   - Async message receiving
   - Command-line interface
   - Commands: /join, /create, /list, /leave, /quit

7. **Logging System** (`shared/utils.h`)
   - Timestamped logging
   - User ID and IP tracking

## Next Steps

### 1. Build the Project (Linux/macOS/WSL)

**Note**: The project uses POSIX sockets which work on Linux/macOS/WSL but need modification for Windows.

```bash
# Using CMake (recommended)
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

# Or compile manually
g++ -std=c++17 -pthread server/main.cpp -o chat_server
g++ -std=c++17 -pthread client/main.cpp -o chat_client
```

### 2. Run the System

**Terminal 1 - Start Server:**
```bash
./chat_server
# Or with custom port and SJF scheduling:
./chat_server 8080 sjf
```

**Terminal 2 - Start Client 1:**
```bash
./chat_client
> /list
> /join 1
> Hello!
```

**Terminal 3 - Start Client 2:**
```bash
./chat_client
> /join 1
> Hi there!
```

### 3. Test All Features

- [ ] Create a new group: `/create MyGroup`
- [ ] List groups: `/list`
- [ ] Join a group: `/join 1`
- [ ] Send messages
- [ ] Switch groups
- [ ] Join as new client (should receive history)
- [ ] Check logs in `logs/` directory
- [ ] Test graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C on server)

### 4. Generate Performance Data

Run the server with multiple clients sending messages to collect:
- Tasks processed
- Average task time
- Cache hit/miss ratio
- Cache evictions

Statistics are displayed when the server shuts down.


### 7. Windows Compatibility (If Needed)

The current code uses POSIX sockets. For Windows:

**Option A**: Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Easiest option, no code changes needed

**Option B**: Modify for Winsock
- Replace `#include <sys/socket.h>` with `#include <winsock2.h>`
- Add `#pragma comment(lib, "ws2_32.lib")`
- Initialize Winsock with WSAStartup()
- Replace close() with closesocket()

## OS Concepts Checklist

✅ **Threads/Processes**: Thread pool with 4 worker threads  
✅ **Synchronization**: Mutexes, condition variables, deadlock prevention  
✅ **Scheduling**: Round Robin and Shortest Job First  
✅ **Socket Programming**: TCP client-server communication  
✅ **Memory Management**: Smart pointers, LRU cache  
✅ **Caching**: LRU with TTL and statistics  
✅ **File I/O**: Logging system  
✅ **Binary Protocol**: ChatPacket with network byte order  
✅ **Interrupts**: Signal handling for graceful shutdown

## Tips for Presentation (Dec 2)

1. **Practice the demo** - Make sure server and clients work smoothly
2. **Have data ready** - Run tests to get real performance numbers
3. **Know your code** - Be ready to explain any implementation detail
4. **Show logs** - Demonstrate the logging system works
5. **Explain trade-offs** - Why RR vs SJF, LRU vs other caching
6. **Time management** - 10-15 min presentation, 5 min Q&A

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Compilation errors about missing headers  
**Solution**: Make sure you're on Linux/macOS/WSL, or modify for Windows

**Issue**: Port already in use  
**Solution**: Use a different port: `./chat_server 9000`

**Issue**: Permission denied  
**Solution**: `chmod +x chat_server chat_client`

**Issue**: Can't connect to server  
**Solution**: Check firewall, make sure server is running first
